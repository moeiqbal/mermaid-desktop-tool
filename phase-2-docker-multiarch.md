# Phase 2: Multi-Architecture Docker Build Support

## Overview
Extend the Docker build configuration to support both ARM64 (Apple Silicon) and AMD64/x86-64 (Intel/AMD) architectures. Currently, the application only builds for ARM64, preventing deployment and usage on x86-64 based systems including most cloud providers, CI/CD pipelines, and Intel-based machines.

## Phase 2 Detailed Todo List

### 1. Environment Setup & Analysis
- [ ] Audit current Docker configuration in `docker/` directory
- [ ] Review existing Dockerfile for architecture-specific configurations
- [ ] Check docker-compose.yml for platform specifications
- [ ] Verify Docker buildx is available and configured
- [ ] Document current build process and identify limitations

### 2. Docker Buildx Configuration
- [ ] Enable Docker buildx for multi-platform builds
- [ ] Create/update buildx builder for multi-architecture support
- [ ] Test buildx builder configuration with simple multi-arch build
- [ ] Document buildx setup requirements for development team

### 3. Dockerfile Optimization
- [ ] Review base images for multi-architecture compatibility
- [ ] Update Node.js base image to support both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
- [ ] Verify all dependencies support both architectures
- [ ] Test Python packages (if any) for cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Optimize Dockerfile for efficient cross-compilation

### 4. Build Scripts & Commands
- [ ] Update existing build commands to include platform specifications
- [ ] Add `--platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64` to build commands
- [ ] Create new build script for multi-architecture builds
- [ ] Update docker-compose.yml for development with architecture selection
- [ ] Document new build command examples

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- [ ] Identify current CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Update pipeline to build and push multi-arch images
- [ ] Configure Docker registry for multi-architecture image storage
- [ ] Test automated builds for both architectures
- [ ] Set up build verification on different platforms

### 6. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test ARM64 build functionality (existing)
- [ ] Test AMD64 build on x86-64 system
- [ ] Verify image runs correctly on both architectures
- [ ] Test container performance on both platforms
- [ ] Validate all application features work on both architectures
- [ ] Test deployment scenarios (cloud providers, local Intel machines)

### 7. Documentation & Team Enablement
- [ ] Update build documentation with multi-arch instructions
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for architecture-specific issues
- [ ] Document performance considerations for cross-compilation
- [ ] Update README.md with new build commands
- [ ] Create team training materials for multi-arch development

## Technical Implementation Details

### Build Command Examples
```bash
# Multi-architecture build and push
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t app:latest --push .

# Development build with architecture selection
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t app:dev-amd64 .
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t app:dev-arm64 .
```

### Docker Compose Updates
```yaml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      platforms:
        - linux/amd64
        - linux/arm64
```

### Architecture Detection
```dockerfile
# Example multi-stage build with architecture awareness
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM node:18-alpine AS base
ARG TARGETPLATFORM
ARG BUILDPLATFORM
```

## Files to be Modified/Created

### Docker Configuration
- [ ] `docker/Dockerfile` (modify for multi-arch)
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` (add platform specifications)
- [ ] `docker-compose.dev.yml` (if exists, update)

### Build Scripts
- [ ] `scripts/build-multiarch.sh` (new)
- [ ] `scripts/build.sh` (modify existing or create)

### CI/CD
- [ ] `.github/workflows/` or CI config files (modify)
- [ ] Build pipeline configuration

### Documentation
- [ ] `README.md` (update build instructions)
- [ ] `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` (create or update)
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` (update Docker commands section)

## Architecture Compatibility Checklist

### Base Images
- [ ] Node.js 18+ (supports multi-arch)
- [ ] Alpine Linux (supports multi-arch)
- [ ] Ubuntu (if used, supports multi-arch)

### Dependencies
- [ ] NPM packages (verify architecture-agnostic)
- [ ] Native modules (check for pre-built binaries)
- [ ] System libraries (verify availability on both platforms)

### Application Components
- [ ] Frontend build process (Vite/React)
- [ ] Backend runtime (Node.js/Express)
- [ ] File processing libraries
- [ ] Mermaid.js rendering
- [ ] YANG parsing libraries

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Docker images build successfully for both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
- [ ] Application runs correctly on Intel/AMD x86-64 systems
- [ ] Application continues to work on Apple Silicon ARM64 systems
- [ ] Multi-arch images can be pushed to container registry
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline builds and tests both architectures
- [ ] No performance degradation on either platform
- [ ] Development team can build locally on any architecture
- [ ] Cloud deployment works on common providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)

## Performance Considerations
- [ ] Cross-compilation build time impact
- [ ] Image size optimization for both architectures
- [ ] Runtime performance parity between platforms
- [ ] Memory usage consistency across architectures

## Deployment Scenarios
- [ ] Local development (Intel Macs, M1/M2 Macs, Linux x86-64)
- [ ] Cloud providers (AWS EC2, GCP Compute, Azure VMs)
- [ ] Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- [ ] CI/CD environments (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)

## Estimated Timeline
**Total: 8-12 hours**
- Environment Setup & Analysis: 2 hours
- Docker Configuration: 3 hours
- Build Scripts & CI/CD: 3 hours
- Testing & Validation: 3 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour

## Risk Mitigation
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with current ARM64 builds
- [ ] Create rollback plan if multi-arch builds fail
- [ ] Test extensively before production deployment
- [ ] Monitor build performance and optimize if needed
